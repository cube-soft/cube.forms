The Cube.Forms packages provides GUI components available for .NET Framework 3.5, 4.5, .NET 5.0, or later.
The package also provides the functionality to support the MVVM pattern in WinForms applications.
Note that basic functionality for the MVVM pattern is implemented in the [Cube.Core](https://github.com/cube-soft/Cube.Core), and the WPF part is in the [Cube.Xui](https://github.com/cube-soft/Cube.Xui).
